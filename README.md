# Intelligence-Density
"Intelligence Density" is a novel metric for evaluating AI model efficiency by measuring intelligence relative to resource consumption. This repository explores and formalizes the concept, providing a structured approach to balance performance and resource use, with applications in optimizing explainable and interpretable AI models.
